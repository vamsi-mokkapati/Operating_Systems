Descriptions of Included Files:

lab3b.py:
This is the source code in python that reads in all 6 of the CSV files
generated from project 3A and uses them to check for the different types
of errors and output them in the correct error report format to
lab3b_check.txt. This script successfully identifies and reports errors
relating to unallocated blocks, duplicately allocated blocks, unallocated
inodes, missing inodes, incorrect link counts, incorrect directory entries,
and invalid block pointers. 

Makefile:
This is the file that can successfully build the tarball and execute the
program with shell commands. The default action is making sure the user
has execution permissions on lab3b.py, and "make run" will execute the
program. The makefile also has clean and dist targets to remove generated
files and create the tarball, respectively.

README:
This is the file that describes all the included files, contains the
shell command to execute the program, and includes information about
testing features and methodology.

Shell Command to Execute Program:

"python lab3b.py"

Other Information:
Testing for this script was done by checking if the functions for each of the
error types added the correct messages to the output file. By comparing the
output of my script with the given lab3b_check.txt file using the "diff" and
"sort" commands, I was able to ensure that my script operated as it should.
The block number information from the inode.csv file was used extensively
in order to detect unallocated blocks, duplicately allocated blocks, and more.
Since many global arrays, dictionaries, and variables are filled with information
at the start from the CSV files, the functions can use these without calling an
initialization function multiple times; this aspect of my code increases
efficiency. As far as my testing went, there were no limitations to be found
when tested with the given 6 CSV files, and all outputs to the error report
were found to be correct.
